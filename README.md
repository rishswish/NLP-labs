Steps to be followed
1. Upload Dataset
2. Split Train and Test
3. Calculate emission probability matrix for train
4. Calculate transition probability matrix for train
5. Implement Vertibi Algorithm for finding tag of unseen data

Lab5
Write a program to generate sentences using Context free grammar.
Write a program to implement CKY algorithm to parse a given string.

Lab6
Write a program to implement Bag of words model using python
Steps to be followed: -
Step 1: Convert the above sentences in lower case as the case of the word does not hold any information.
Step 2: Remove special characters and StopWords from the text. StopWords are the words that do not contain much information about text like ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘the and many more’.
Step 3: Go through all the words in the above text and make a list of all of the words in our model vocabulary.

Write a program to implement IF-IDF Model using python
Steps to be followed:-
Step1: Corpus: - Shakespeare’s corpus from nltk
Step2: Computing Term Frequency
Step3: Computing Inverse Document Frequency
Step4: Putting it Together: Computing TF-IDF

Lab7
Implement Lesk’s algorithm for word sense disambiguation
Step 1: Import Library’s
Step2: Perform Tokenization
Step3: Take the ambiguous word and find the semantic of a word within various different context.

Lab8
Implement a program to Identify the word senses using "synset" in NLTK
Import WordNet form NLTK corpus reader.
Look up a word using Synsets ().
Look up a definition of word found in Synsets.
Look up for the examples of the words found in Synsets.
Find a set of synonyms that share a common meaning.
Find a set of antonyms that does not share a common meaning.
Find a set of hyponyms and hypernyms of a word..
